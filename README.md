# 2D Platformer Project

## Overview

This project is a simple yet engaging 10-level platformer developed using Unity and Kenny Assets. As my third small game with Unity, it features a mix of single-player and two-player levels, providing a variety of challenges and gameplay mechanics.

## Features

- **Diverse Levels**: Includes both single-player and cooperative two-player levels.
- **Enemies**: Levels feature both chasing and non-chasing enemies.
- **Dynamic Platforms**: Experience levels with moving platforms that add to the challenge.
- **Bonus Levels**: Unlock additional content and bonus levels.
- **Mojo Coins**: Players can collect mojo coins to:
  - **Shoot at Enemies**: Use coins as ammunition against enemies.
  - **Super Boost**: When both players' mojo meters are full, gain a super boost for a few seconds.
